#1
-- In the accounts table, there is a column holding the website for each company.
-- The last three digits specify what type of web address they are using.
-- A list of extensions (and pricing) is provided here: https://iwantmyname.com/domains.
-- Pull these extensions and provide how many of each website type exist in the accounts table.

select right(a.website,3) as top_level_domain, count(*) as cnt
from accounts a
group by 1


# 2
-- There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a company name) matters.
-- Use the accounts table to pull the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of company names
-- that begin with each letter (or number).

select left(a.name,1) as first_letter, count(*) as count
from accounts a
group by 1
order by 2 desc 


# 3
-- Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups:
--      one group of company names that start with a number,
--      and a second group of those company names that start with a letter.
-- What proportion of company names start with a letter?

-- I had to peek at the solution for this one.  I was leaning toward using regexp, but the simplicity
-- of the IN (...) is great as well.

# 4
-- Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u.
-- What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?

-- borrowing from the solution for #3, use a case statement.
